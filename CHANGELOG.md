## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Login rate limiting / account lockout** (issue #560): `POST /api/v1/usuarios/login`
  now locks a username out for a configurable duration (`security.login.lockout-duration-ms`,
  default 15 minutes) after a configurable number of consecutive failed attempts
  (`security.login.max-attempts`, default 5), returning `429 Too Many Requests`. A
  successful login resets the counter. Implemented in the new
  `com.licensis.notaire.security.LoginAttemptService`.

- **Jakarta Bean Validation on request boundaries** (issue #561): `UsuarioController`'s
  `createUsuario`/`updateUsuario` now validate the request body (`@NotBlank nombre`, `tipo`),
  and `ReporteController`'s path/query parameters are validated (`@Positive` on ID-like
  parameters, `@NotBlank` on `nombreTipoTramite`, `@Min(1)/@Max(12)` on `mes`), returning a
  clean `400` instead of a generic `500` or silently accepting malformed input.
  `GlobalExceptionHandler` now handles `MethodArgumentNotValidException` (body validation) and
  `ConstraintViolationException` (`@RequestParam`/`@PathVariable` validation) consistently.
  Full rollout across the remaining controllers is tracked as a follow-up.

### Fixed

- **Login attempt double-counting** (found while implementing #560): `UsuarioController.login()`
  fell through to its "usuario no encontrado" branch even when a username **was** matched but
  the password was wrong or the account was inactive, executing that branch's logic in addition
  to the matched-user branch. Fixed by returning immediately once a matching user has been
  handled.

- **E2E coverage reports were a fabricated static template** (issue #587): the
  `.github/workflows/playwright-e2e.yml` "Business Coverage Report" job wrote an identical
  hardcoded markdown block to `docs/wiki/cicd-reports/e2e-coverage-*.md` on every run,
  including a stale action item ("Fix backend 500 errors on testimonio endpoints") that had
  sat unchanged for 6+ weeks regardless of actual results. Replaced with
  `scripts/generate_e2e_coverage_report.py`, which parses the real Playwright JSON reporter
  output (`test-results/results.json`) and Bruno CLI JSON output (`bruno-results.json`) to
  report actual pass/fail/skip counts and the actual failing test titles, with no fabricated
  numbers when a results file is missing.

- **Flyway single source of truth**: Removed dual schema source (init-db + Flyway)
  - Removed `init-db:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d` volume mount from docker-compose.yml
  - PostgreSQL now starts empty; Flyway applies all V1→V11 migrations on startup
  - Created V11 migration to fix `conceptos.version` for "Documentacion" (id=3)
  - Rewrote `BaseIntegrationTest.java` to enable Flyway instead of copying init-db scripts
  - Renamed `InitDbSchemaValidationIntegrationTest` → `FlywaySchemaValidationIntegrationTest`
  - Archived `init-db/` directory to `docs/archive/init-db/`
  - Updated all documentation, agent configs, and `.claude/rules/database-migrations.md`
  - See `.claude/rules/database-migrations.md` for new migration workflow
