# Traceability

> Governed by [CONSTITUTION.md](../../../../CONSTITUTION.md) — P4 Traceability.
> This is the change's ledger. It is created during planning with the upstream

> Tasks stay `pending` until the corresponding step actually happens — never

## Requirement coverage

<!-- Every `#### Scenario:` in the delta spec is an Acceptance Criterion and must
     appear here with the test that proves it. Requirement coverage is not code
     coverage: a green suite with an unmapped scenario means the criterion is
     unverified. -->

| Scenario (Acceptance Criterion) | Test | Status |
|---------------------------------|------|--------|
| Host zone exported into backend | TS-0016 CU23-GW01 | passing |

## Permanent documentation updated

<!-- Mirror of proposal.md — Documentation Impact, confirmed at Gate 3.
     Reference the documents; do not restate their content. -->

| Document | Updated | Commit |
|----------|---------|--------|
| `CHANGELOG.md` | no | pending |
