# Traceability

> Governed by [CONSTITUTION.md](../../../../CONSTITUTION.md) — P4 Traceability.
> This is the change's ledger. It is created during planning with the upstream

> Tasks stay `pending` until the corresponding step actually happens — never

## Requirement coverage

<!-- Every `#### Scenario:` in the delta spec is an Acceptance Criterion and must
     appear here with the test that proves it. Requirement coverage is not code
     coverage: a green suite with an unmapped scenario means the criterion is
     unverified. -->

|---------------------------------|------|--------|
| wheel installs and reports its version | PackagingTest, KitVersionTest | pending |
| install from the wheel yields a healthy repository | PackagingTest, KitVersionTest | pending |
| wheel excludes adopter content and tests | PackagingTest, KitVersionTest | pending |
| matching version | PackagingTest, KitVersionTest | pending |
