## Requirement coverage

<!-- Every `#### Scenario:` in the delta spec is an Acceptance Criterion and must
     appear here with the test that proves it. Requirement coverage is not code
     coverage: a green suite with an unmapped scenario means the criterion is
     unverified. -->

|---------------------------------|------|--------|
| short actuator password rejected | ProductionCredentialsGuardTest | pending |
| deny-listed actuator password rejected | ProductionCredentialsGuardTest | pending |
| empty actuator credentials rejected | ProductionCredentialsGuardTest | pending |
| strong actuator credentials accepted | ProductionCredentialsGuardTest | pending |
| development is not checked | ProductionCredentialsGuardTest | pending |
