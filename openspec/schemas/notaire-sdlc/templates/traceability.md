# Traceability

> Governed by [CONSTITUTION.md](../../../CONSTITUTION.md) — P4 Traceability.
> This is the change's ledger. It is created during planning with the upstream
> links filled in, and completed as the change moves through the gates. Rows below
> Tasks stay `pending` until the corresponding step actually happens — never
> pre-fill them.

## Requirement coverage

<!-- Every `#### Scenario:` in the delta spec is an Acceptance Criterion and must
     appear here with the test that proves it. Requirement coverage is not code
     coverage: a green suite with an unmapped scenario means the criterion is
     unverified. -->

| Scenario (Acceptance Criterion) | Test | Status |
|---------------------------------|------|--------|
| <!-- scenario name --> | <!-- test class / spec file --> | <!-- pending / passing --> |

## Permanent documentation updated

<!-- Mirror of proposal.md — Documentation Impact, confirmed at Gate 3.
     Reference the documents; do not restate their content. -->

| Document | Updated | Commit |
