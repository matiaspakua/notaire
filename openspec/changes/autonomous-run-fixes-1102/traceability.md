## Requirement coverage

|---------------------------------|------|--------|
| The repair closes an unterminated cmd string (2 scenarios) | `test_harmony_repair.py`, `test_patch_omlx.py` | pending |
| A pending review note requires a change (1 scenario) | replay `foreman.sh 1049 spec` | pending |

## Permanent documentation updated

| Document | Updated | Commit |

| `local-ai/sdlc/AI-SDLC.md` | pending | pending |
| `local-ai/README.md` | pending | pending |

## Gate log

| Gate | Condition | Passed | Evidence |
|------|-----------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Issue + Specification + Acceptance Criteria | yes | #1102, this folder, `validate-sdlc-plan.sh` green |
| 2 | Failing tests written, test cases designed | pending | pending |
| 3 | Suite green, coverage held, docs updated | pending | pending |
| 4 | CI green, review approved, no conflicts | pending | pending |
| 5 | Deployed, smoke test passed, Issue closed | pending | pending |

## Exceptions

- No Playwright or backend tests: the change touches only the local-AI setup and
  harness. The repair and patcher have Python `unittest` suites; the `with_retries`
  check is shell, verified by `bash -n` and a replay of the #1049 spec phase.
