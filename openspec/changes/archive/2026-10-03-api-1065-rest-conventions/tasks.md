## 1. Gate 1 — Prerequisites

- [x] 1.1 GitHub Issue exists, labeled, and linked to a Use Case (`CU-XX` / `RF-XX` / `RNF-XX`)
- [x] 1.2 Use Case documentation exists and is accurate — create or update it first if not
- [x] 1.3 Acceptance Criteria defined as scenarios in the delta spec
- [x] 1.4 Impact Analysis and affected modules confirmed in `proposal.md`
- [x] 1.5 ADR recorded under `docs/200-architecture/202-ADR/` if the change is architectural
- [ ] 1.6 Move the Issue to IN PROGRESS (`gh issue edit <n> --add-label "in-progress"`) — API denied; noted in status file

## 2. Crear branch

- [x] 2.1 `git checkout main && git pull origin main`
- [x] 2.2 `git checkout -b cursor/api-1065-rest-conventions-69d3`
- [x] 2.3 Record the branch name in `traceability.md`

## 3. Gate 2 — Escribir tests (TDD, failing first)

- [x] 3.1 Enumerate test cases: happy path, edge cases, error paths
- [x] 3.2 Write the unit tests for every scenario in the delta spec
- [x] 3.3 Write the integration tests where applicable
- [x] 3.4 Run them and **observe them fail** — compile miss for `CreatedResponses` + failing Location/params/status assertions
- [x] 3.5 Confirm every `#### Scenario:` in the delta spec maps to at least one test

## 4. Implementación

- [x] 4.1 Add `CreatedResponses` (or equivalent) shared Location helper under adapter/web support
- [x] 4.2 Wire `POST /api/v1/pagos` create to return 201 + Location via helper
- [x] 4.3 Wire `POST /api/v1/folio` create to return 201 + Location via helper
- [x] 4.4 Change `POST /api/v1/minutas-inscripcion` generate to 201 + Location
- [x] 4.5 Remove `POST /api/v1/pagos/params` handler and OpenAPI annotations
- [x] 4.6 Author ADR-023 + index README entry
- [x] 4.7 Update REST endpoint registry and CHANGELOG BREAKING notes

## 5. Actualizar tests existentes

- [x] 5.1 Identify existing tests affected by the change (see design.md — Regression Strategy)
- [x] 5.2 Update them without weakening assertions; document why any old expectation was wrong
- [x] 5.3 Remove tests made genuinely obsolete, stating the reason

## 6. Ejecutar regresión

- [x] 6.1 `mvn test -pl backend-api` — unit + integration
- [x] 6.2 `mvn jacoco:check -pl backend-api` — coverage ratchet floor
- [x] 6.3 `mvn verify -pl backend-api` — all quality gates (Checkstyle, SpotBugs)
- [x] 6.4 Bruno payments regression (`bru run 00-auth payments` — 22/22 PASS)
- [x] 6.5 No `@Disabled` or skipped tests without documented, approved justification

## 7. Ejecutar Playwright

- [x] 7.1 Add/update the E2E specs listed in design.md — Playwright Strategy
- [x] 7.2 `cd frontend && npx playwright test` — n/a (no UI surface)
- [x] 7.3 Verify the affected screens at 320px, 768px and 1024px — n/a
- [x] 7.4 If the change has no UI surface, record "n/a — no UI surface" here with the reason
  (backend REST contract + ADR only; no frontend changes)

## 8. Gate 3 — Actualizar documentación permanente

- [x] 8.1 Update every permanent document listed in proposal.md — Documentation Impact
- [x] 8.2 Update OpenAPI/Swagger annotations if endpoints changed, and verify in Swagger UI
- [x] 8.3 Update `CHANGELOG.md` (`[Unreleased]`) for user-visible changes
- [x] 8.4 Archive superseded documents into `docs/000-archive/`
- [x] 8.5 Confirm no information was duplicated — permanent docs remain the single source of truth
- [x] 8.6 `bash scripts/preflight.sh --fix` — mirrors every CI gate
  (our change validates; repo-wide validate fails on unrelated CLOSED-issue
  stale OpenSpec changes already on main — not introduced by #1065)

## 9. Commits atómicos

- [x] 9.1 Commit in small, self-contained units, Conventional Commits format
- [x] 9.2 Every commit message ends with `Closes #<issue-number>`
- [x] 9.3 No secrets, no commented-out code, no unrelated changes
- [x] 9.4 Record the commit SHAs in `traceability.md`

## 10. Pull Request y validación CI

- [x] 10.1 `git push -u origin <branch-name>`
- [x] 10.2 Open the PR titled `[#<issue>] <type>(<scope>): <description>`, referencing Issue and Use Case
- [ ] 10.3 Wait for every required workflow to pass: `ci.yml`, `pr-validation.yml`, `frontend-ci.yml`, `playwright-e2e.yml`
- [ ] 10.4 Gate 4 — CI green, code review approved, no merge conflicts, docs complete
- [x] 10.5 Record the PR number in `traceability.md`

## 11. Deploy

- [ ] 11.1 Merge via the Pull Request only — never push to `main`
- [ ] 11.2 Confirm the CD pipeline (`cd.yml`) published the image to GHCR
- [ ] 11.3 Record the merge commit and release/tag in `traceability.md`

## 12. Gate 5 — Smoke test y cierre

- [ ] 12.1 Run the smoke test on the target environment (health endpoint + the key flow of this change)
- [ ] 12.2 Verify the rollback path is still available as described in design.md
- [ ] 12.3 Close the GitHub Issue, referencing the PR
- [ ] 12.4 Archive the change: `openspec archive <change-name>`
